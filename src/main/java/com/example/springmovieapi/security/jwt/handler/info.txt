The three classes JwtAuthEntryPoint, CustomAccessDeniedHandler, and RestAuthenticationFailureHandler work together to
handle different types of authentication and authorization failures.

When a user tries to access a protected resource without providing proper authentication credentials, the JwtAuthEntryPoint
class is responsible for returning an HTTP 401 Unauthorized response, indicating that the user is not authorized to access the resource.

If the user provides valid authentication credentials but is still not authorized to access the resource (e.g., they don't have the proper role or permissions),
the CustomAccessDeniedHandler class is responsible for returning an HTTP 403 Forbidden response. This class can also be used to customize the response message or format.

Finally, if there is an error during the authentication process (e.g., invalid credentials or expired tokens), the RestAuthenticationFailureHandler class
is responsible for returning an HTTP 401 Unauthorized response. This class can also be used to customize the response message or format.

By configuring these three classes, you can handle different types of authentication and
authorization failures and customize the response messages and formats to meet your specific needs.
